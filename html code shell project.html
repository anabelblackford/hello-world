      <h2>Something I learned</h2>
      <p>I've learned so much in this course. I learned how to make an entire website on my own off of code. With there being different kinds of code that have to be right in order for it to appear on the website, you learn this sense of patience because of the trial and error you experience. I now know how to add pictures and make text glide across the screen. Learning to adding color to everything is very fun too!</p>

      <h2>Describe HTML</h2>
      <h5>HTML language is the skeleton and body of your website. With HTML you are able to create your website with code and determine where items go to make your website as cohesive or sporatic and you choose to have it. The language also allows you to add pictures, graphs, charts, and more. If you have issues with your HTML coding and you do not have a teacher present you always have the sourse of W3schools.com, which is very helpful and allows you to try out the code before you actually add it to your site. Overall, the HTML language lets you add content to your page.</h5>

      <h2>Describe CSS</h2>
      <h5>CSS Language gives the website PAZAZZZZZZZZ!! The style page is so much fun because you can pick the colors for every aspect of your page. You can do very basic colors to the ombre to full on rainbow gradients. It also allows you to mess with the text; meaning what size you'd like it, the kind of font you prefer and more. You can edit the size of your main frame boxes and well and the border you want around it. You could have your basic solid border or a dotted on. </h5>
